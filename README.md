# Select to Search (STS)

**Select to Search (STS)** is a lightweight Linux utility inspired by Android's "Circle to Search." It lets users on X11-based Linux systems select any region of the screen and perform a contextual search.

Why X11 only? Because that's what the developer uses. :)

Depending on how the program is run, results are either shown in your default browser (as an HTML page) or via a native desktop notification.

## âœ¨ Features

- Select any screen area to trigger a search.
- Two output modes:
  - **Browser Output:** Default behavior. Opens an HTML file with the search result.
  - **Notification Output:** Run with the `-n` flag to receive the result via desktop notification.
- Lightweight and fast.
- Works on all X11-based Linux desktop environments.
